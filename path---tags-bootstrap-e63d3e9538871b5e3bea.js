I published the beta version of my site on a slack group to get some feedback and a few friends pointed out a couple of responsive issues, apparently the posts main image wasn’t acting as a responsive image although it had the class img-responsive applied to it. I opened up my fav ide ATOM and started looking at the code, checking my media queries, but everything was looking fine, so I looked at bootstraps main css file and the specific class, nothing weird was there, so my head started spinning around this issue.</p>\n<p>After a couple of minutes testing, creating a separate class for the image(just for testing, which worked by the way) I decided to add a simple line to the img-responsive class. width:100% and eureka!!! it worked, but since I don’t like modifying the main bootstrap css file, I created an img-responsive class in my main css file to overwrite bootstraps’.</p>\n<p>I know there are probably a couple of other ways to solve this, but i came up with this simple work around to that issue.</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="css">\n      <pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css"><span class="token selector">// In your css file\nimg-responsive</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>  \n    <span class="token property">display</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> block<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n    <span class="token property">max-width</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 100%<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n    <span class="token property">width</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 100%<span class="token punctuation">;</span> &lt;--- this line was added\n    <span class="token property">height</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> auto<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>I have to mention that I’m working on a Kali(debian based pentesting distro) with iceweasel as the main browser, testing in on chrome worked like a charm.
