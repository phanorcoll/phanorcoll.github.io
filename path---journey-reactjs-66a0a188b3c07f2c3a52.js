So here is where my journey really begins.</p>\n<p>So many tutorials out there, from the official documentation to specialized courses, I had to decide where to start. Nothing better than to start with the official doc, life was looking good, but then the confussion began. When looking at other tutorials I noticed that javascript was written differently, here comes the versioning of javascript, es5, es6 and not to mention the compilers that I needed to configure when working with Reactjs. So I took a step back and started learning webpack since its the backbone for every Reactjs project that I’ve seen and/or worked on. How to configure SASS, resource loading, optimizing images and of course the compiler so I can use the new version of javascript (which I love. I was always forgetting to use .bind but the arrow functions really solved that).</p>\n<p>After getting the hang of webpack , and stablishing a basic starting point for every Reactjs project (I just fork that from my repo and I know I have a working starting point), I moved to reactjs itself, playing around with it, seeing how it worked, what can I do with it, the use of the virtual dom. I though life was good again, but then here comes Redux, although not made only for reactjs, it really helped me managed application state, at first it was confusing, jumping from handling the states within reactjs to using a (middleware) for it, but boy, I have to say, it’s really handy for creating clean and understandable code. All of this I had to learn it while working on projects and applying that new knowledge to it, I think its the best way to learn, under pressure!!! and on live projects(wouldn’t you agree?) :)</p>\n<p>My journey with Reactjs or any related technology is far from over, as the projects grow in complexity and its popularity keeps increasing, I’ll learn even more.</p>\n<p>So to recap my steps for leaning and working with <strong>Reactjs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn webpack</li>\n<li>Learn Reactjs</li>\n<li>Create a working initial point of modules and .conf files to save time</li>\n<li>Play around and keep creating with Reactjs</li>\n<li>Consume APIs (<a href="https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis">here</a> is a collective list of public JSON APIs you can use to practice or even use on your projects)</li>\n</ul>',frontmatter:{title:"My Journey with Reactjs",date:"October 20, 2016",path:"/journey-reactjs",tags:["reactjs","front-end","es6"],excerpt:"So, for the past few years I’ve been diving into different kinds of projects, from converting PSDs designs into HTML(5) websites using CSS(3) and my favorite tool SASS or Bootstrap 3, to coding backend modules with Go or PHP(Laravel) and creating clusters for Neo4j with Docker containers"}},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"Phanor Coll - Fullstack Developer",author:"Phanor Coll",siteUrl:"http://www.phanorcoll.com",disqusShortname:"phanorcoll"}}},pathContext:{prev:{html:'<h2>A few weeks ago a I decided to try out elementaryOS, being a core fedora user, it was confusing at first, especially with the package manager, moving from dnf to apt-get / aptitude, I’m still getting the hang of it, for managing packages, etc.</h2>\n<p>Being a fullstack developer I’ve come to love <a href="http://docker.com/">docker</a>, so naturally it was one of the first things that I needed to install on elementaryOS, but I had some issues following the <a href="https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-server-ubuntu">instructions at the Docker Store</a> and trying to apply them to elementaryOS, after doing some research I came to this solution, hopefully it’ll help others in my situation.</p>\n<p>Follow the initial instructions found here , but when you get to the part</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="console">\n      <pre class="language-console"><code class="language-console">sudo add-apt-repository \\\n   &quot;deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\\n   $(lsb_release -cs) \\\n   stable&quot;</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>replace <strong>$(lsb_release -cs)</strong> with <strong>xenial</strong></p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="console">\n      <pre class="language-console"><code class="language-console">sudo add-apt-repository \\\n   &quot;deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\\n   xenial \\\n   stable&quot;</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>and continue following the documentation.</p>\n<p>PS. if you want to run docker without the SUDO command, follow these <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/linux-postinstall/">instructions</a></p>\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>',id:"/home/development/projects/reactjs/phanorcoll.com/gatsby-blog/src/pages/blog/2018-05-04-docker-compose/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{date:"2018-05-04",path:"/docker-elementaryos",title:"Docker and elementaryOs Loki",excerpt:"A few weeks ago a I decided to try out elementaryOS, being a core fedora user, it was confusing at first, especially with the package manager, moving from dnf to apt-get / aptitude, I’m still getting the hang of it, for managing packages, etc.",tags:["docker","containers","linux","elementaryOs"],featuredImage:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/png;base64,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",aspectRatio:1.4789156626506024,sizes:"(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px",src:"/static/docker-a0107b5b73947a86f0f7957067fdda2b-1c558.png",srcSet:"/static/docker-a0107b5b73947a86f0f7957067fdda2b-e7e2a.png 123w,\n/static/docker-a0107b5b73947a86f0f7957067fdda2b-fed6a.png 246w,\n/static/docker-a0107b5b73947a86f0f7957067fdda2b-1c558.png 491w"}}}}},next:{html:'<h2>A few days ago I decided to redesign my blog and portfolio, put it all together under the same roof (Ghost)</h2>\n<p>So like I was saying, I wanted to give my website a complete make over, and since i’m a HUGE!! fan of bootstrap, I had to use it, so I downloaded version 3.3.6 and started working on my idea, everything was working fine, our course, this was previous of the testing phase. I published the beta version of my site on a slack group to get some feedback and a few friends pointed out a couple of responsive issues, apparently the posts main image wasn’t acting as a responsive image although it had the class img-responsive applied to it. I opened up my fav ide ATOM and started looking at the code, checking my media queries, but everything was looking fine, so I looked at bootstraps main css file and the specific class, nothing weird was there, so my head started spinning around this issue.</p>\n<p>After a couple of minutes testing, creating a separate class for the image(just for testing, which worked by the way) I decided to add a simple line to the img-responsive class. width:100% and eureka!!! it worked, but since I don’t like modifying the main bootstrap css file, I created an img-responsive class in my main css file to overwrite bootstraps’.</p>\n<p>I know there are probably a couple of other ways to solve this, but i came up with this simple work around to that issue.</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="css">\n      <pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css"><span class="token selector">// In your css file\nimg-responsive</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>  \n    <span class="token property">display</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> block<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n    <span class="token property">max-width</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 100%<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n    <span class="token property">width</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 100%<span class="token punctuation">;</span> &lt;--- this line was added\n    <span class="token property">height</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> auto<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>I have to mention that I’m working on a Kali(debian based pentesting distro) with iceweasel as the main browser, testing in on chrome worked like a charm.
